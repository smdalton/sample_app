# README

Sample App, a fully functional twitter clone that uses postgres and S3 as data and file backends respectively.

This app was completed according to the instructions provided By Michael Hartl in his accompanying course at railstutorial.org

I completed all work myself and implemented all unit testing examples, as well as the supplementary exercises at the end of each chapter so I could learn as much as possible about Ruby on Rails.

Topics that were covered and completed:

* Authentication framework from scratch

* Static site routing and template inheritance through partials

* Static asset management through s3, and database integration with postgreSQL

* Using fixtures, integration tests, unit tests, and best practices to increase code quality as much as possible

* Doing things the *rails way* and how it creates consistent code that works well across teams

* Implementing advanced many-many relationships and specifiy through models as well as custom relationship accessors

* Rails parameter passing scheme and accessing variables inside and outside of views

* Deployment to heroku

* Management of deployment, development, and testing environments


Things that were skipped:

* email verification altough debug mailers were checked and functional
